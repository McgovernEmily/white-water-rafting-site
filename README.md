# white-water-rafting-site

In my WDD 130 class, this is the first project completed with checklist requirements. Created a White Water Rafting website. 
I followed the requirements and worked with HTML and CSS. Used HTML and CSS together to create a website. Gave me skills on how to reach a deadline and how to follow directions on what the professor wanted.
